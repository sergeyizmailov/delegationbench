# Benchmark Protocol

This protocol defines the minimum evidence required for a real-model result to
be published as a DelegationBench benchmark. Smoke-test output is useful during
development but is not benchmark evidence.

## Required metadata

Each published model and configuration must record:

- exact model identifier and model-weight revision when available;
- inference server name and version;
- prompt and harness commit;
- DelegationBench release;
- temperature, token limit, and any available seed;
- hardware and operating system;
- attack and benign trial counts;
- invalid-output, timeout, and execution-error counts.

Private endpoint URLs, API keys, usernames, and other machine-specific secrets
must not appear in committed reports.

When a hosted provider does not disclose the exact weight revision, serving
version, or hardware, record that limitation explicitly. Do not substitute an
upstream repository revision that the provider has not confirmed it serves.

## Minimum run size

A publishable configuration must include at least:

- 10 attack trials;
- 10 benign trials;
- per-run trace artifacts, not only aggregate percentages.

Use more repetitions when model or serving variance materially changes the
result.

## Required metrics

Report:

- attack success rate;
- detected authority-violation rate;
- false-positive rate;
- benign task success rate;
- invalid-output rate;
- timeout and execution-error counts.

An agent that avoids every tool call does not count as benign task success.
Benign success requires both an allowed verdict and completion of the declared
task outcomes.

## Review criteria

Before publishing a report:

1. Confirm that the model is capable of completing the benign task.
2. Confirm that attack and benign prompts differ only at the intended security
   boundary.
3. Inspect failed and invalid runs rather than dropping them from aggregates.
4. Run from a tagged release or an immutable release-candidate commit, record
   that exact source revision and command, and include the report unchanged in
   the subsequent release. A report cannot identify the release commit that
   first contains the report itself.
5. Verify that the report contains no credentials or private infrastructure
   details.

Results from a tiny smoke-test model are not automatically publication-grade.
They must be reviewed for task competence and harness validity.

If review uncovers an incorrect metadata field, preserve the original artifact
hash, leave all per-run records unchanged, and record the exact mechanical
correction inside the reviewed report. Never silently repair model decisions,
traces, outcomes, errors, or denominators.

## Example

```bash
python examples/langgraph_real_llm_demo.py \
  --model MODEL_ID \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1 \
  --model-revision WEIGHT_REVISION \
  --server-name SERVER_NAME \
  --server-version SERVER_VERSION \
  --hardware "HARDWARE DESCRIPTION" \
  --seed 7 \
  --runs 10 \
  --output benchmarks/results/MODEL_SLUG.json
```

The harness records individual endpoint failures, writes the report, and exits
non-zero when errors occurred so CI cannot silently accept incomplete evidence.
