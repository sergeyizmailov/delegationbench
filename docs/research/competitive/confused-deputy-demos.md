# Confused-Deputy Demonstrations in LLM Agents (academic demos)

- **Audit date (access/research date):** 2026-07-23
- **Scope:** The audit target is a category, not a single project. The 3 most relevant concrete demonstrations were selected:
  1. **ConfusedPilot** — confused-deputy attacks on RAG-based LLM systems (UT Austin SPARK Lab + Symmetry Systems)
  2. **Imprompter** — adversarial prompts tricking LLM agents into improper tool use (UCSD / U. Wisconsin)
  3. **Multi-Agent Systems Execute Arbitrary Malicious Code** — control-flow hijacking across multi-agent delegation (Cornell Tech, COLM 2025)
- **Alternatives noted:** AgentDojo (prompt-injection benchmark, not confused-deputy-specific), ASB (Agent Security Bench), ToolEmu — all adjacent but further from the confused-deputy/delegation-chain theme.

## Project A: ConfusedPilot

### 1. What it is
ConfusedPilot is a class of confused-deputy vulnerabilities in RAG-based LLM systems (demonstrated on Microsoft 365 Copilot, plus open-model RAG setups). An attacker whose only capability is adding a document to an indexed data pool causes the Copilot — which acts with the querying user's access rights — to return corrupted, misattributed, or secret-leaking responses, and to propagate misinformation across the enterprise via cascading document poisoning.

- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04870 (v1 2024-08-09, v5 2024-10-23)

### 2. Multi-agent?
**No.** Single RAG assistant. The paper's "cascading attacks" propagate poisoned content between *users* via documents, not between agents delegating to each other.

### 3. Differential privileges?
**Partial (implicit).** The confused-deputy asymmetry is the core of the attack: a low-privilege attacker (write access to a SharePoint/document pool) steers a higher-authority principal (Copilot retrieving with the victim user's permissions, incl. access to confidential docs). But there is no explicit permission model, capability lattice, or per-principal policy — privileges are implicit in the M365 environment.

### 4. Origin tracking?
**No.** The attack works precisely because provenance of retrieved content and the originating user's intent are not tracked. The paper proposes design guidelines (e.g., isolating untrusted content) but implements no origin/identity tracking.

### 5. Chain-wide authority check?
**No.** No authority verification anywhere — that is the demonstrated flaw, not a feature of the work.

### 6. Attack generation?
**No.** Attacks 1–5 are handcrafted malicious strings/prompts embedded in documents. No fuzzing, mutation, or automated generation.

### 7. Exploit minimization?
**No.**

### 8. Regression tests?
**No.** No artifacts emitted; no public code at all.

### 9. ROMA integration?
**No.** No mention of ROMA (sentient-agi).

### 10. Liveness
- No public repository (GitHub search for "confusedpilot" / "confused-pilot" returns 0 repos as of 2026-07-23).
- Paper versions: v1 2024-08-09 → v5 2024-10-23; presented at DEF CON AI Village 2024; ~31 citations.
- Commercial continuation: Symmetry Systems shipped "Confused Pilot Protection" in its Data+AI Security Suite (announced 2025-08-29). The research line is commercially alive, but there is no open-source artifact to track.

### 11. License
**None found** (no code released).

### 12. Overlap verdict
**PARTIAL.** Same conceptual core (confused deputy: low-authority input steers a higher-authority AI acting for someone else), but single-agent RAG only — no multi-agent delegation chains, no differential-permission model, no deterministic oracle, no testbed, no attack generation/minimization/regression-test emission.

## Project B: Imprompter

### 1. What it is
Imprompter is an attack + codebase that uses gradient-based optimization to generate obfuscated adversarial prompts which trick tool-using LLM agents into improper, covert tool use — demonstrated as PII exfiltration from Mistral LeChat via disguised markdown-image URL rendering (and on ChatGLM), without alerting the user.

- Canonical URL: https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero/imprompter
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14923 (Imprompter: Tricking LLM Agents into Improper Tool Use, Fu et al., 2024)
- Site: https://imprompter.ai/

### 2. Multi-agent?
**No.** Single agent with tools (LeChat, ChatGLM, local GLM4/Mistral-Nemo/Llama3.1). No agent-to-agent delegation.

### 3. Differential privileges?
**Partial (implicit).** The agent holds capabilities (network access, image rendering, file/tools) the text-only attacker lacks — the attacker rides the agent's authority. But no explicit permission model or differing per-agent privilege levels.

### 4. Origin tracking?
**No.** No preservation of originating-user intent/identity; covertness (hiding the exfiltration from the user) is the point.

### 5. Chain-wide authority check?
**No.** Per-conversation attack on one agent; no chain concept.

### 6. Attack generation?
**Yes (partial).** The core contribution is an optimization algorithm that *generates* adversarial prompts (min-heap of top-100 prompts by loss, checkpointable, restartable via `--start_from_file`). This is genuine automated attack synthesis, though it generates prompts against a fixed scenario rather than fuzzing delegation scenarios.

### 7. Exploit minimization?
**No.** It ranks prompts by loss but does not minimize an exploit trace to a shortest reproducer.

### 8. Regression tests?
**No.** It emits evaluation results (pkl/json metrics), not standalone regression tests.

### 9. ROMA integration?
**No.**

### 10. Liveness
- Stars: 54; forks: 5; open issues: 1.
- Commits: 7 total, all between 2024-10-17 and 2024-10-22; last push 2024-10-22.
- Releases: 0. Cadence: one-shot artifact release, dormant since Oct 2024.

### 11. License
**GPL-2.0** (per GitHub API license field).

### 12. Overlap verdict
**PARTIAL.** It has real attack *generation* (a fuzzer-like optimizer), which DelegationBench also wants — but it targets a single agent's improper tool use, with no delegation chains, no differential-privilege model, no origin tracking, no oracle-judged escalation detection, and no minimization/regression emission.

## Project C: Multi-Agent Systems Execute Arbitrary Malicious Code (Triedman, Jha, Shmatikov — COLM 2025)

### 1. What it is
A demonstration paper showing that adversarial content (web pages, files, email attachments) can hijack the *control flow and communication* of LLM multi-agent systems, causing the orchestrator to route work into unsafe agents/tools — resulting in arbitrary malicious code execution on the user's device or data exfiltration from the user's container. Attacks succeed at 58–90% (up to 100% in some model-orchestrator pairs) **even when individual agents refuse the harmful action in isolation** — i.e., the delegation graph, not any single agent, is the vulnerability.

- Canonical URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12188 (v1 2025-03-15, v2 2025-09-12; COLM 2025)
- Author page: https://rishijha.com/pubs/cfh.html — its `[code]` link is empty; no public repository found (GitHub search for the arXiv ID returns 0 repos as of 2026-07-23).

### 2. Multi-agent?
**Yes.** Explicitly targets multi-agent frameworks ("several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks"), hijacking orchestrator routing and inter-agent communication. This is the closest match to DelegationBench's delegation-chain setting.

### 3. Differential privileges?
**Partial.** Agents have heterogeneous capabilities/tools (benign agents vs. agents with code execution, filesystem, network); the attack's essence is chaining low-risk agents into a high-capability one. But privileges are implicit framework features — no formal per-agent permission model is defined or checked.

### 4. Origin tracking?
**No.** The paper demonstrates the absence of origin/intent propagation: the user's original task is benign while the routed agent chain does something the user never asked for. No mechanism is built to track or enforce origin.

### 5. Chain-wide authority check?
**No.** Precisely the gap it exposes: per-agent refusals exist but nothing verifies authority across the whole chain. The paper calls for "trust and security models for multi-agent systems" but does not build one or a testbed for one.

### 6. Attack generation?
**No.** Handcrafted adversarial content and control-flow-hijack payloads, replayed across orchestrators to measure attack success rates. No fuzzer/mutator.

### 7. Exploit minimization?
**No.**

### 8. Regression tests?
**No.**

### 9. ROMA integration?
**No.** No mention of ROMA (sentient-agi).

### 10. Liveness
- No public code repository; paper-only artifact.
- arXiv v1 2025-03-15, v2 2025-09-12; accepted at COLM 2025; actively cited by 2026 follow-on work (e.g., OWASP AISVS C09-08 cites it for control-flow-hijacking requirements).

### 11. License
**None found** (no code released).

### 12. Overlap verdict
**PARTIAL — closest of the three, but not equivalent.** It demonstrates exactly the failure class DelegationBench targets (a delegation chain performing actions the originating user never authorized, with differential agent capabilities), but it is a demonstration, not a testbed: no deterministic oracle, no explicit privilege model, no origin tracking, no attack generation/mutation, no exploit-trace minimization, no regression-test emission, and no reusable open-source harness.
