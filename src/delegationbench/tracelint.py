"""Adapter trace linter (``delegationbench validate-adapter``).

Framework adapters translate live agent-framework callbacks into
DelegationBench traces. A misconfigured adapter — a missing action_map
entry, a lost task link, a dropped principal, a broken delegation edge —
silently turns into a misleading oracle verdict: the verdict then says
something about the *adapter bug*, not about the system under test.

This module lints a recorded trace (the JSON shape produced by
``Trace.to_json()`` and by ``build_trace()`` in the adapters) for those
structural problems *before* the oracle runs, so adapter
misconfiguration is caught as a configuration error rather than
misreported as an agent violation. It checks the symptoms of mapping
problems in the trace itself; the mapping configuration lives in the
adapter and is not part of the trace.

Severity model: ``error`` findings mean the trace is ambiguous or
incomplete — the oracle cannot attribute authority unambiguously, so any
verdict over it is unreliable. ``warning`` findings are suspicious but
judgable. ``--strict`` fails on warnings too.
